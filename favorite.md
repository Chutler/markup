My Favorite Vacation
====================

> I've traveled to Europe a number of times
> I don't recommend it for those fearful of other cultures

* Berlin is a particularly good time if you like beer and schnitzel.
  However the people rarely smile.
* France is great fun if you are a foodie.
  However, avoid French Canadians.

But my favorite vacation was traveling to Italy.  All I did was drink espresso and speak with a fake Italian accent.
